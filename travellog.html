    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <h1>6/28/18</h1>
    <p>     Our journey begins by traveling to the Saint Louis Gateway Amtrak station. Almost 6 hours later we made it to Chicago.
     We had finally arrived in the Windy City. Upon arrival of Union Station we then procceded to drop of luggage to our hotel so we could contiue our adventures.
     After droping of our luggage the group went to a resturant called the Little Goat where we then had lunch.
     After everyone had eaten our group walked on down to the Willis Tower (Sears Tower). After stepping inside the Willis Tower we walked through the maze to reach the sky deck.
     Finally after waiting in line and then being tightly packed into an elevator we had made it to the top of the tower.
     When at the top we then waited in another line to be able to stand on the glass deck. We took some pictures and jumped while on the glass.
     In conclusion being able to see an entire city is an expirence one never forgets. But oh no our journey for the day does not end here.
     We then made a little trip down to the infamous bean. </p>

    <h2> Day 2</h2>
    <h1>6/29/18</h1>
    <p>     Another day another adventure. But today instead of being at the top we look down below...to the ocean, or to Shedd Aquarium.
     We got to be one with the fish and see numerous amounts of incredible sea life. Along with see sea life we also touched some slimy sting rays.
     Although the movie we watched about sharks was a tad bit scary it was sure a spittin' good time. But after many hours at the Aquarium we were a bit hungry.
     So a trip to get food was in order. We traveled via pedi cab. We were able to see a spectacular view of the lake and the city.
     After the pedi cab ride we made it to the Gage. At first glance to picky people their menu might seem a bit daunting but once you get over that fear you got to have some amazing food.
     We procceded to head to the hotel and rest up for what is planned for tomorrow.</p>
     <h2>Day 3</h2>
     <h1> 6/30/18</h1>
     <p>    Today we start off with a trip to the Museum of Science and Industry. Goodness everything about this museum was incredible by the way it was layed out and the exhbits that it had.
     We were lucky enough to have gone to the museum while they were having their pixar exhbit. That expirence gave a completely new outlook to all the animated movies we watch.
     Being able to see what really goes on within the production of these movies and do some hands on actvities was incredible.But moving on from pixar.
     The museum had a station called the mind ball. At this staion it is two people going head to head to see who can focus more and stay more relaxed. 
     The more focused you are the closer the ball moves towards your opponent. Science is pretty crazy dude.
     We were also able to see the most spectacular doll castle, containing real crystal and diamonds in the chandeler.</p>
     <h2>Day 4</h2>
     <h1> 7/01/18</h1>
     <p>    On this day we went on down to the Field Museum. While we were there we were able to see mummies and incredible jewels along with some really cool totem poles.
     There was a slight upset because Sue the T-Rex was being moved into a different display and was not out for viewing at the time. But the group was still able to see a lot of other cool attractions.
     While in the mummy exhbit we were able to learn about the different proccesses of mummying. We also learned that with modern technology scientists are able to generate what the people would have looked like.
     Next we moved to the section containg Native American art, they had beautiful totem poles and the most precise baskets. After a little rest the group headed to milenimum park.
     Being in the park right around sunset gave the gorgeous view of the skyline with a cotton candy sky behind it.</p>
     <h2>Day 5</h2>
     <h1> 7/02/18</h1>
     <p>    Our last day in Chicago was definetly not wasted. In the morning we walked down the river and went on a boat tour. The architechtual tour was a great expirence.
     Giving all of the history behind the huge buildings makes the city seem more personal touch. Instead of the city seeming like a massive man made empire it makes it seem more nature involved.</p>
